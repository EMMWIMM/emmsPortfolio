     <div class="aboutMe">

      <p>this is a little paragraph about me. becasue we are supposed to put one here lol. I have two cats, weyland and newt, a vinegaroon named flopsy and one (1) husband named wil who I love dearly.
    I've only been coding for about a month and a half and if the two weeks we've been in class we've already surpassed everything I learned before we started.
  I'm also an artist and amature animator. hopefully someday I can make art a living but until then code seems like a pretty awesome and practical career.  this is probs more than you needed to know and I will edit this later yeehaw</p>
